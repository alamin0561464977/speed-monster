                <h3>Differences between local storage end session storage?</h3>
                <p>The difference between localStorage and sessionStorage has to do with lifetime and scope: how long
                    the data is saved for and who the data is accessible to. Session storage is destroyed once the user
                    closes the browser whereas, Local storage stores data with no expiration date.</p>

                <h3>What is the difference between a global and a local variable in JS?</h3>
                <p>A global variable has a global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code.
                    Local Variables âˆ’ A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined.
                    Function parameters are always local to that function.</p>

                <h3>What is event loop in JavaScript?</h3>
                <p>The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. When an
                    asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the
                    event loop will again check for any other tasks that need to be performed</p>
