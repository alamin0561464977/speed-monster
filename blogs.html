                <h3>Differences between local storage end session storage?</h3>
                <p>The difference between localStorage and sessionStorage has to do with lifetime and scope: how long
                    the data is saved for and who the data is accessible to. Session storage is destroyed once the user
                    closes the browser whereas, Local storage stores data with no expiration date.</p>

                <h3>What is the difference between a global and a local variable in JS?</h3>
                <p>A global variable has a global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code.
                    Local Variables âˆ’ A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined.
                    Function parameters are always local to that function.</p>
